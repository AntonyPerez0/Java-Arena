# Lesson content

This folder holds the course: `course.yaml` (every planned module, in order, with the MOOC sections it follows) and one file per written module in `modules/`, named after its place in the course (`01-printing.yaml`).

## How a module is checked

`npm run content` (also part of `npm run build`) reads every module and checks it with the reference JDK (Eclipse Temurin 21.0.10+7, fetched by `scripts/get-jdk.sh`, or `JAVA_HOME`):

- every solution compiles without warnings and runs on every test input without an error; the expected outputs the site grades against are what it really prints;
- an `expect` written in a test must match that output exactly;
- starter code must not already pass, and a fill-in with every blank empty must not pass;
- every solution follows its own `require` and `forbid` rules;
- every example program in the lesson text is compiled and run, and an `output` block after it must be exactly what it prints;
- every step has exactly three challenges, a `**Your turn:**` task and at least one hint per challenge.

`npm run content:browser` (after `npm run build`) then replays every program in the browser engine and fails if anything differs from the JDK.

## Writing a module

```yaml
id: printing                # must match an id in course.yaml
summary: One or two sentences for the module page.
steps:
  - id: printing-first-program   # permanent: progress is saved by it
    slug: first-program          # the address: /learn/printing/first-program
    title: Your first Java program
    text: |
      The lesson, in Markdown. Headings start at ###.

      **Your turn:** the task for challenge 1. Everything from here on is shown in the task card.
    fill: |                      # challenge 1 as a fill-in: [[answer]] marks a blank,
      ...System.out.[[println]]("Grace Hopper");...     # [[a‖b]] accepts a or b
    hints:
      - Shown one at a time.
    tests:
      - expect: Grace Hopper     # optional; checked against the real output
    more:                        # challenges 2 and 3, each with a task
      - task: |
          What to do.
        seed: |                  # starter code (for a code challenge)
          ...
        solution: |
          ...
        hints: [...]
        tests:
          - stdin: |             # input the program reads
              Ada
          - stdin: Linus
            hidden: true         # hidden tests stop hard-coded answers
        require:                 # rules on the code, with comments and strings removed first
          - pattern: System\.out\.println\s*\(
            min: 3               # optional counts; raw: true checks the code as written
            max: 3
            message: Shown when the rule isn't met.
        forbid:
          - pattern: ...
            message: ...
```

Every Java block in lesson text says what it is:

- ` ```java run ` a complete program; it's compiled and run. An ` ```input ` block right after it is what it reads, and an ` ```output ` block after that must be exactly what it prints.
- ` ```java main ` statements that are run inside a main method (imports such as `java.util.Scanner` are added when used); same checks.
- ` ```java error ` code that must not compile. A ` ```javac ` block after it must be exactly what javac prints.
- ` ```java fragment ` a piece of code that can't run on its own; shown only.
